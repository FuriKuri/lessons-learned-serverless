## Description
This are the slides for my talk about Serverless Architecture and my learnings and opinions so far. My goal is to provide beginners and advanced users the lessons I learned the hard.

## Learnings
Learnings will be displayed a simple sentences and should be taken into account as a guide in a not dogmatic way. Please disagree with me!

**I welcome changes and question. Please just open an issue with context, description etc.**

## Links
I provide a lot of links of books, articles and videos to watch to dive deep into the topic.
